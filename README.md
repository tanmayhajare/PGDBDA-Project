# Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project is focused on developing an effective fraud detection system for insurance companies using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained using Kaggle dataset. Using Information Gain model features were extracted. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python were used for visualisation. The model was built utilising 8 different classification models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Network.

## Project Workflow
The project will follow the following workflow:

    Data collection and preprocessing: Collecting and cleaning the customer data, and preparing it for analysis.

    Exploratory data analysis: Analyzing the data to identify any patterns or anomalies that may be indicative of fraudulent behavior.

    Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming the relevant features for model training.

    Model training: Using various machine learning algorithms to train models for fraud detection.

    Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using  accuracy score.

    Model prediction: Predicting if given claim is fradulent or not using one of the algorithms which has highest accuracy score.

## Conclusion
- In conclusion, insurance fraud detection using machine learning is a critical aspect of the insurance industry. ML algorithms can analyze large datasets and detect patterns and anomalies that are indicative of fraudulent claims. By identifying fraudulent claims early, insurance companies can save significant amounts of money and reduce their overall losses.
- Overall, the use of machine learning in insurance fraud detection has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and profitability of the insurance industry while also ensuring that honest policyholders are not penalized by fraudulent claims.
